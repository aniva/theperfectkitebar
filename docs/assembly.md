# How to assemble ThePerfectKiteBar

## Tools Required

You will need the following tools to assemble the bar:

- **Hacksaw** – For cutting carbon fiber tube.  
- **Drill** – For precision hole-making.  
- **Measuring Tape** – Ensures accurate component placement.  

## EVA Non-Slip Heat Shrink Tube Installation

To install the **EVA non-slip heat shrink tube**, follow these steps:

1. Use **100°C boiling water** or a **heat gun** to shrink the tube.  
2. If using a heat gun, apply heat evenly, working from **one end to the middle**, while slowly rotating the bar.  
3. Ensure the tube is **fully heated**; **insufficient heating may cause slipping or stretching** during use.  
4. EVA heat shrink tubing typically **does not shrink lengthwise**, so you can cut it **to the exact required length** before installation.  
5. **Cutting tip:** Use a **scalpel** to cut the tube while it is flat for a clean edge.  
6. **Recommended tube size:**  
   - **25mm diameter** tube fits both **OD 24mm carbon tubes** and **OD 22mm carbon tubes**.  

## Testing and Tuning

Before using **ThePerfectKiteBar**, ensure optimal performance by following these steps:

- **Strength Testing** – Apply load gradually to verify the bar’s durability.  
- **Balance Check** – Ensure the control bar is symmetrical for even response.  
- **Line Tension Adjustment** – Tune the flying lines for **optimal kite control**.
