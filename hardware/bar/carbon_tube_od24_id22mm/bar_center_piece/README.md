# Central Piece installed on carbon tube (od 24, 22mm ...) 

Central piece for a **24mm** carbon tube — Variant 7.

Variant 7 is the result of many design iterations focused on:
- Robustness
- Aesthetics
- Minimal offset from the bar center
- Secure installation of heat-shrink tubing

## Notes on Versions

The central piece comes in two versions based on the bolt size:

| Version | Description | Recommended Use |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| 3mm Bolt | Most robust, "bomb-proof" option | Recommended for maximum durability |
| 2.5mm Bolt | Lighter, more compact version with a smaller footprint in the bar center | For those prioritizing weight saving |

Choose the version based on your specific needs — maximum strength or lightweight minimalism.
