## **Materials List**
The following materials are required to assemble **ThePerfectKiteBar**:

- **Carbon Fiber Tube** – [Specify dimensions, supplier link]  
- **Dyneema Line** – [Specify type, length, supplier link]  
- **Quick Release System** – [Specify type, supplier link]  
- *(Add more materials as needed)*  

---

## **Tools Required**
You will need the following tools to assemble the bar:

- **Hacksaw** – For cutting carbon fiber tube.  
- **Drill** – For precision hole-making.  
- **Measuring Tape** – Ensures accurate component placement.  
- *(Add additional tools if necessary)*

## **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Step 1: [Title]**
*[Provide a detailed description of the first step. Include images or diagrams for clarity.]*

### **Step 3: EVA Non-Slip Heat Shrink Tube Installation**
To install the **EVA non-slip heat shrink tube**, follow these steps:

1. Use **100°C boiling water** or a **heat gun** to shrink the tube.  
2. If using a heat gun, apply heat evenly, working from **one end to the middle**, while slowly rotating the bar.  
3. Ensure the tube is **fully heated**; **insufficient heating may cause slipping or stretching** during use.  
4. EVA heat shrink tubing typically **does not shrink lengthwise**, so you can cut it **to the exact required length** before installation.  
5. **Cutting tip:** Use a **scalpel** to cut the tube while it is flat for a clean edge.  
6. **Recommended tube size:**  
   - **25mm diameter** tube fits both **OD 24mm carbon tubes** and **OD 22mm carbon tubes**.
