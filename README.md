3. **Step 3: EVA Non-Slip Heat Shrink Tube Installation**  
   To install the **EVA non-slip heat shrink tube**, follow these steps:  

   - Use **100Â°C boiling water** or a **heat gun** to shrink the tube.  
   - If using a heat gun, apply heat evenly, working from **one end to the middle** while slowly rotating the bar.  
   - Ensure the tube is **fully heated**; insufficient heating may cause it to **slip or stretch** during use.  
   - EVA heat shrink tubing typically does **not shrink lengthwise**, so you can cut it **to the exact required length** before installation.  
   - **Cutting tip:** Use a **scalpel** to cut the tube while it is flat for a clean edge.  
   - Recommended tube size:  
     - **25mm diameter** tube fits both **OD 24mm carbon tubes** and **OD 22mm carbon tubes**.  


## Safety Precautions

* **Warning 1:** [e.g., Always wear safety glasses when cutting materials.]
* **Warning 2:** [e.g., Ensure lines are properly secured before applying tension.]
