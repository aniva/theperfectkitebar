## **Materials List**

The following materials are required to assemble **ThePerfectKiteBar**:

- **Carbon Fiber Tube** â€“ [Specify dimensions, supplier link]  
- **Dyneema Line** â€“ [Specify type, length, supplier link]  
- **Quick Release System** â€“ [Specify type, supplier link]  
- *(Add more materials as needed)*  

---

## **Tools Required**

You will need the following tools to assemble the bar:

- **Hacksaw** â€“ For cutting carbon fiber tube.  
- **Drill** â€“ For precision hole-making.  
- **Measuring Tape** â€“ Ensures accurate component placement.  
- *(Add additional tools if necessary)*

### **Step 3: EVA Non-Slip Heat Shrink Tube Installation**

To install the **EVA non-slip heat shrink tube**, follow these steps:

1. Use **100Â°C boiling water** or a **heat gun** to shrink the tube.  
2. If using a heat gun, apply heat evenly, working from **one end to the middle**, while slowly rotating the bar.  
3. Ensure the tube is **fully heated**; **insufficient heating may cause slipping or stretching** during use.  
4. EVA heat shrink tubing typically **does not shrink lengthwise**, so you can cut it **to the exact required length** before installation.  
5. **Cutting tip:** Use a **scalpel** to cut the tube while it is flat for a clean edge.  
6. **Recommended tube size:**  
   - **25mm diameter** tube fits both **OD 24mm carbon tubes** and **OD 22mm carbon tubes**.

## **Parts for Prints**

The [hardware](hardware) directory contains the parts needed to build/improve ThePerfectKiteBar. All parts will have the following files.

- A `.step` file to allow importing the model in your favorite 3D software.
- A`.shapr` file allowing you to improve/edit the existing model using [shapr3d](https://www.shapr3d.com).
- A `.stl` file containing the ready to print part.

The entire control bar is made of the following parts that can be 3D printed or laser cut.

- Bar
  - [`Bar end (2x)`](<hardware/bar/bar end/README.md>)
  - [`Center piece`](<hardware/bar/center piece/README.md>)
- Quick Release System
- Line accessories
  - [`V-Spliter`](hardware/accessories/v-splitter/README.md)
  - Swivel
  - Trim

## **Safety Precautions**

Please follow these safety guidelines when assembling and using the kite bar:

- âš  **Wear Safety Gear** â€“ Always wear **safety glasses and gloves** when cutting materials.  
- âš  **Secure Components** â€“ Ensure **lines and hardware** are properly attached before applying tension.  
- âš  **Use Heat Tools with Caution** â€“ When using a heat gun or boiling water, handle materials carefully to **avoid burns**.  
- *(Add more safety notes as necessary)*
